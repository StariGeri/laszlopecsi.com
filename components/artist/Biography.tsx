            &quot;I was born on the 5th of October, 1929, in Angyalföld, Budapest. I got my school-leaving certificate in 1948, at the &quot;Beresznyi Dániel&quot; secondary school of Budapest. From autumn 1949 on, I studied at the textile faculty of the Hungarian High School for Applied Arts where I learned designing of woven materials from Ernő Schubert. Here I got my diploma in 1954 (red diploma). From 1950 to 1954 I was holder of a Rákosi scholarship. I lived at a NEKOSZ college of which I was secretary for one year.
                I married rather young, my wife is a teacher (1951).

                My first work to be exhibited won a prize at the World Youth Festival Competition, National Salon, in 1950 (I was a first-year student at that time).
                I became an industrial designer. I began to work at the Factory for Furnishings in Kőszeg, in 1954. I was alone – the factory had never had a designer before me. They made me move to Kőszeg where I lived from 1955 to 1957.
                At the competitions of the Council for Applied Arts I was awarded several prizes. Naturally with fabrics designed for the factory.
                At another World Youth Festival Competition, in May 1957, I was awarded First Prize.
                At the end of the 1950-es, a competition for the “Most Beautiful Product of the Year” was started, and every year the fabrics I had produced at the factory, were awarded.
                In 1963 a new firm was founded by the fusion of several firms, under the name of “Csepel” for Household Textiles, and I became chief of the Department for Designing.
                <br /> <br />
                In 1964 I was awarded the 3rd degree of Munkácsy Prize,
                in 1972 with the 2nd degree of Munkácsy Prize,
                in 1975 I got the 1st degree of the State Prize.
                I also got diplomas and certificates of merit (Eminent Worker of the Light Industry, etc.).
                I was awarded several prizes at the 1st – 2nd – 3rd Wall and Space Textile Biannuals.
                I am travelling abroad a great deal, especially due to my works connected with industry. In the press, in books I have often been criticized, less praised for my works. In 1973 TV made a separate film about my works.&quot;

                Here the autobiography breaks off; eleven years were left of his short-cut life. About these – had he completed it – probably one thing would have been written only:
                &quot;I am working a lot.&quot;
